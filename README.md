# 2darrayinpattern
Printing a 2d array in a defined pattern
Write a program to do basic string compression. For a character which is consecutively repeated more than once, replace consecutive duplicate occurrences with the count of repetitions.
For e.g. if a String has 'x' repeated 5 times, replace this "xxxxx" with "x5".
Note : Consecutive count of every character in input string is less than equal to 9.
